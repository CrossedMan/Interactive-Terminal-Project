# Interactive-Terminal-Project
Creating a conversational terminal script.

I'm trying to become more proficient in my python coding by making something fun but simple. Jumping into PyGame seemed like a massive mistake when I barely grasp the fundamentals. So this is my file attached above. I can't image anyone coming to my GitHub site for any reason but if your here and want to help, it's welcome as long as I'm learning from it. Don't want anyone doing the work for me.

Anyways, everytime I work on a file I update issues and notes in the top section of the code using a multiline str. Really didn't know this was here in GitHub so I may change it to display my issues here.
